### Contributing

Please open an issue regarding any changes you wish to make before starting to work on anything. I am always open to providing assistance, so if you need to ask any questions please don't hesitate to do so, whether it be how to approach solving a problem or questions regarding how I might prefer something be implemented.

This project uses [Rufo](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo) to format its source code, and pull requests will not be accepted unless all code has been run through it.

#### Running tests

I use `rspec` for testing. If submitting a pull request, always include tests if possible. Please adhere to the testing style in the pre-existing tests, particularly when testing a new component.
